# Truth table

## Javascript is an odd fellow, and its take on equality is a constant reminder of this

So install this

```shell
npm i -g truth-table
```

run this

```shell
truth-table
```

... and you should see an adorable, difficult to read, javascript equality table right in your terminal.

_kind of like this_
